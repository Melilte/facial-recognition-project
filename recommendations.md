# Recommendations for Safer and More Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Technology

Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) can be useful, but it must be used responsibly.  
Below are recommendations to reduce harm, promote fairness, and increase public trust.

---

## 1. Improve Accuracy and Reduce Bias

Companies should train facial recognition models using **diverse datasets** that include:  
- women  
- darker skin tones  
- different ages  
- different lighting conditions  

This reduces misidentification and makes the system more accurate for everyone.

## 2. Require Transparency and Consent

Organizations using FRT should clearly inform people when the technology is being used.  
This includes:  
- clear signs  
- public policies  
- options to opt out when possible  

Transparency builds trust.

## 3. Establish Government Regulations and Policies

Governments should create strict rules such as:  
- banning FRT in schools  
- requiring warrants for law enforcement use  
- forcing companies to delete data after a certain period  

Policies ensure the technology is not abused.

## 4. Use Human Oversight

FRT decisions should **never** be fully automated.  
A trained human must verify matches before any actions are taken (like arrests or denials of service).

---

## 5. Protect User Data and Privacy

Biometric data (faces) should be stored securely or not stored at all.  
Strong encryption and limited storage reduce privacy risks.

## Summary

These recommendations help ensure FRT is used responsibly, ethically, and safely—protecting both individuals and society.
