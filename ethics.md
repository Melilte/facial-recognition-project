# Critical Discussion: Social and Ethical Implications of Facial Recognition Technology

Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) is powerful, but it raises major ethical concerns, especially when used without transparency or oversight.

## Social Implications

**Privacy Risks:**  
FRT can track individuals without their consent in public and private spaces.  
This creates surveillance concerns and threatens personal freedom.

**Bias and Discrimination:**  
Studies show FRT is less accurate for women and people of color.  
Misidentification can lead to wrongful arrests, job denial, or discrimination.

**Loss of Trust:**  
If companies or governments use FRT secretly, the public may lose trust in institutions.

## Ethical Lens 1: Utilitarianism (Greatest Good for the Greatest Number)

A utilitarian perspective supports FRT if it provides more benefits than harm.  
For example:  
- finding missing people  
- catching criminals  
- improving safety in airports  

However, if the technology causes widespread harm (e.g., wrongful arrests, surveillance of innocent people), then utilitarianism considers it unethical.

## Ethical Lens 2: Rights-Based Ethics (Protecting Individual Rights)

Rights-based ethics argues that every person has the **right to privacy**, **consent**, and **freedom**.  
Scanning faces without permission violates these rights.

Even if FRT helps society, violating personal rights makes the practice unethical under this lens.
